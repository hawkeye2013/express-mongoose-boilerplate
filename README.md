# Express Mongoose Boilerplate W Testing

This boilerplate is designed to allow you to quickly and easily spool up a boilerplate project which uses Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, and node clustering. This boilerplate comes wired up with Jest and Supertest, to allow you to not think about setting up a project and just jump right in! By default, a testing pipeline is set up via github actions for `master` and `dev` branches to test both unit and integration tests on `push` and `pull-request`. By no means is this the only way to create a service. It's one of my favorites though!
